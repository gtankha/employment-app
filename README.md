  ## 3. Usage
  
  Application provides the ability to do the following: 

  As a 'Seeker' you add your name to a list of potential candidates for employeers to show interest in, you can also show interest in employers. If both you and an Employer show  interest in eachother, you are matched up for an interview.
  
  As an Employer you can create jobs for Seekers to browse and show interest in. If you select a Seeker for a job they show interest in, you get a confirmed interview.
  
  Associating your jobs, or if you're a job seeker, your user profile with a set of skills will improve the accuracy of your job matches, or matching candidates if you're a Company. If a candidate has one or more skills that match the skill requirements of a specific job, he will appear under the tab "job matches by skill", and vice-versa. To add skills, first create your user profile, if you're a seeker. Then go to the dashboard, or click "edit profile" in the homepage, and check de boxes with the skills you would like to select. As a company, first create a job on the dashboard, then click to edit the job you would like to add skills to, and check the boxes with the corresponding skills and click submit.
  
  When there's mutual interest between candidate and company for a specific job opening, that interest will appear under the confirmed interviews tab.
